## AI Model Configuration

The application uses a consolidated configuration system for AI models, ensuring consistency between frontend and backend:

- Primary configuration in `src/services/aiConfig.ts`
- Mirrored in `supabase/functions/chat/config.ts` for the backend
- Re-exported from `src/lib/aiConfig.ts` for backward compatibility

#### Setting Up AI Models

1. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   # Primary OpenAI API key
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

   # DeepSeek fallback API key
   VITE_DEFAULT_OPENAI_KEY=your_deepseek_key
   
   # Optional: Override model IDs
   VITE_LLM01=meta-llama/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct:free
   VITE_LLM02=mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct
   VITE_LLM03=openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
   ```

2. The system automatically handles model selection and fallback:
   - If the primary model fails, it switches to DeepSeek
   - A notification appears when fallback is activated

#### Testing the Fallback Mechanism

You can directly use the DeepSeek fallback model to test without relying on actual model failures:

1. **DeepSeek Test Option**: Select "DeepSeek (Direct Fallback Test)" from the model dropdown
2. **Direct Access Button**: Click "Use DeepSeek Directly" 
3. **Environment Variable**: Set `VITE_LLM03=fallbackllm` to make GPT-3.5 automatically use DeepSeek

This configuration ensures consistent model behavior between frontend and backend components.
